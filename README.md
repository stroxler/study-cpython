# Notes and code for studying CPython

## CPython source code

The CPython directory contains a copy of the CPython source
code as of July 3rd 2023 (sha 58906213cc5d8f2be311664766b4923ef29dae1f).

I've vendored it in because I want to be able to (a) have it fast
to clone, which a full CPython with history is not, and (b) make
it easy to potentially add inline notes if I find that I need this
as I study.
